<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I have been working as a software developer since 1995. First on a Data Warehouse using Oracle 7.3, 8 and 9i SQL and PL/SQL on a Unix platform and running windows and thereafter on many more orojects, including mainframes where COBOL procedures made calls to the Oracle database (8,9). Later on I was part of projects developing custom software for the backend of web sites.</p>

<p>I took some time away from permanent work to do contract / freelancing work and to travel. </p>

<p>This year I completed courses on the latest versions of Oracle (11g and 12c) SQL and PL/SQL. I am currently learning Web development and new languages, specifically Java SE 8 and Python . This portfolio website is a record of my journey, starting with HTML-only projects. I hope to master full-stack development in the next two months.</p>
